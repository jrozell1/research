Researcher
degree in concentration.

Unknown Speaker   
I have a Bachelors of Science in history, and then I have a minor in education and a minor in geography.

Researcher
Awesome. Okay, we're gonna move into those content specific questions now. The first one, do you feel your pre service teacher training adequately prepared you to teach in the social studies classroom? Explain why or why not?

Unknown Speaker  
You said pre service. So like before we did student teaching?

Researcher
Student teaching can be included in that. 

Unknown Speaker  
Okay, I would say probably not. Because when I went through the program, we got one social studies specific education course, that did not occur until our final year. So we were already in the classroom student teaching before we had anything that was specific to teaching socialists, we had all of our history courses, but that was in the learning concept of it not in the application of what's the best way to teach this. And even that course was that one semester, it was very short it mixed in and it was like one I think it was like one night a week when I took it put minus like when we were student teaching and other things like that. So I didn't feel like it gave a as much as we could have or some of the other content gets.

Researcher
Okay. Second question. What types of classes did you take in your teacher training that support social studies, specifically.

Unknown Speaker  
specifically, it would just be that teaching social, secondary Social Studies course. The others, a lot of the examples that were used were more towards elementary students. And we're not applicable to the age groups that I teach.

Researcher
Got it? Okay. Third question, Did you receive training on how to teach skills beyond social studies content? This would be skills like critical thinking, historical empathy, or cultural understanding

Unknown Speaker  
of critical thinking, yes. Empathy and cultural understanding, not so much. We got a little bit of that from the teacher side in our diversity course. But it wasn't so much of how to teach it, it was just the expectation of you should have it.

Researcher
Okay. Fourth question, based on your teacher training, how were you trained to see teach social studies content? So like, what methods and styles Did they tell you to use or teach you to use?

Unknown Speaker   
They talked a lot about scaffolding. But there wasn't any specific methods per se. I mean, we did a practice lesson. But mostly it was talking about the different like the theologies, and common things like that, within education, but it wasn't specifically like this is the best way to teach this specific subject, or present this material. Hold on one second. Sorry.

*Interuptions happened when someone knocked on their door* 

Researcher
Okey doke. Um, so that brings us to question five, did you receive pre service teacher training that gave you confidence to teach social studies content? Um,

Unknown Speaker  
I wouldn't say that the training gave me the confidence to teach the subject I just to have a decent knowledge of the subject. And so I think that impacted my confidence, but I wouldn't say the training itself. gave that confidence.

Researcher
Okay. Question six, what training did you wish you had more of during your pre service teacher training?

Unknown Speaker  
I wish I had seen more examples of like social studies, lesson plans, and applications of the best way to teach. That's not like I'm receiving the lesson but I'm observing the teaching of the lesson outside of just when I was student teaching, because at that point, it was like I'm, I was trying to catch it in TN mimic it, he mmediately and I wasn't able to kind of reflect on it and learn that best process for them.

Researcher
Yeah, yeah, I totally get what you're saying. I feel that way too with mine. Okay, next question, what professional development training have you received since teaching that specifically helps you with teaching social studies content.

Unknown Speaker  
Um, we have had last year, everything was really more about COVID, and all of that things. So I would say this year, we have had some where it's like, more of connecting, like our standards with the ELA standards, and some of the those processes like we have, like specific reading skills and things and I'm looking for and like detective activities, and pulling information out of texts and things like that. So we've done some PDS this year, where we're taking those social studies text, and providing those those questions and, and framing it up for them and similar ways that Ela is doing so to make those cross standards.

Researcher
Yeah. Um, one more question. What social studies related issues do you believe to be the most important issues to teach to students? Ooh,

Unknown Speaker  
social studies, issues. Um, that's a hard one, because I love all of it. And I think all of it's important, I would say, probably, in the older age, and the older grades, I think having more of those contemporary issues, things that are actively going on in the world, so that they have the ability to learn what's going on, be aware of what's going on, and formulate personal individualized opinions without influence of like, homes and things like that, you know, trying to decide who they are. I think that's really important. Because a lot of high schoolers are coming out of high school, and they don't have their own opinion, and they don't know how to make it. But I would also say like in middle school, we do a lot of the ancient stuff, which is great is really important, but I would like to see a little more of the more modern things that has more like closer impact that they can look back and see you know, this is happening here. And this same thing happened or similar happened here. So they can see that cyclical or repetition that happens. Because when we talk about like the ancient societies, it's really hard for them to kind of see that repetition. Because we only talk about ancient societies in sixth grade and then seventh graders middle history, and so it's hard to make those connections.
